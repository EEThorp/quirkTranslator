HOMESTUCK TEXT TRANSLATOR - HOW TO RUN THE WEB INTERFACE
=========================================================

IMPORTANT: This web application uses ES6 modules, which require a web server to run properly.
You cannot simply open index.html directly in your browser due to CORS restrictions.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

Option 1: Using Python (recommended for quick testing)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Open a terminal/command prompt in this directory
2. Run one of these commands depending on your Python version:
   
   Python 3:
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   Python 2:
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

3. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

Option 2: Using VS Code Live Server Extension
----------------------------------------------
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on index.html
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

Option 3: Using Node.js http-server
------------------------------------
1. Install http-server globally: npm install -g http-server
2. Run: http-server -p 8000
3. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

USAGE:
