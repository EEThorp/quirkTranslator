# Homestuck Text Translator - Web Interface Implementation Summary

## Files Created

### 1. `index.html`
- Main page structure with the "Homestuck text translator" header
- Input section with textarea and yellow hexagon submit button
- Workskin formatting checkbox and custom color dropdown
- Handle abbreviations checkbox (checked by default)
- Collapsible Canon section with 12 character checkboxes
- Collapsible Unda Canon section with 3 character checkboxes
- Site links section with placeholder links
- Dynamic output container for translation results

### 2. `styles.css`
- Dark technological theme (blacks and grays)
- Subtle hexagon background pattern
- Responsive layout with CSS Grid
- Collapsible section styling with animated arrows
- Yellow accent color for submit button (honeycomb theme)
- Professional typography and spacing
- Hover effects and transitions
- Mobile-responsive design

### 3. `main.js`
- ES6 module imports for all translator functions
- State management using shared state object from inputs.js
- Event listeners for all UI interactions
- Dynamic output box generation based on character selection
- Character-specific output handling:
  - **Sollux**: Main output + blind/half-dead variant checkboxes
  - **Disciple**: Two outputs (with/without puns) + start/end quirk checkbox
  - **Nepeta**: Two outputs (with/without cat puns) + start/end quirk checkbox
  - **Equius**: Two outputs (with/without horse puns) + start/end quirk checkbox
  - **Eridan**: Two outputs (with/without seadweller puns)
  - **Feferi**: Two outputs (with/without seadweller puns)
  - **Gamzee**: Two outputs (alternating caps) + sober checkbox
  - **Others**: Single output box
- Real-time translation updates when options change
- Extensive comments for maintainability

### 4. `HOW_TO_RUN.txt`
- Instructions for running the web application
- Explains the need for a local server (CORS restrictions)
- Provides three different methods to serve the application
- Usage instructions
- Reference to adding new translators

## Files Modified

### 1. `inputs.js`
- Added `state` object for mutable state management
- Exported `state` and `workskinArr` for use in web interface
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing console-based code

### 2. `quirk_translator_regex_fork.js`
- Updated all translator functions to use `state.variableName` instead of module-level variables
- Added comprehensive export statement for all translator functions and pun converters
- Now works seamlessly with the web interface

## Features Implemented

✅ Text input with submit button  
✅ Workskin formatting with custom color selection  
✅ Handle abbreviations toggle  
✅ Collapsible character selection sections  
✅ Dynamic output generation  
✅ Character-specific variants and options  
✅ Real-time translation updates  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Hexagon-themed UI  
✅ Comprehensive code comments  
✅ Easy to extend with new translators  

## How to Use

1. Start a local web server (see HOW_TO_RUN.txt)
2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
3. Enter text to translate
4. Select translation options
5. Choose characters from Canon or Unda Canon sections
6. Click the arrow button to translate
7. View results in dynamically generated output boxes

## Architecture

- **Shared State**: All translator functions and the UI share a single state object from inputs.js
- **Modular Design**: Each component (HTML, CSS, JS) is separated and well-documented
- **Dynamic UI**: Output boxes are generated programmatically based on user selection
- **Extensible**: Clear instructions provided for adding new translators

## Notes

- The state object allows the UI to control translator behavior dynamically
- All translator functions were updated to read from `state.propertyName`
- The web interface is fully functional and matches the wireframe design
- Code is thoroughly commented for future maintenance and expansion
