                    <h2>About the translators</h2>
                    <p>Each of the translators takes your input and applies a preset list of rules to transform the inputted text and then produces an output. The rules for each character are broadly in line with what is seen in the canon text and what is listed on the wiki. Some transformations are simply not possible or practical to code in. Below you will find a list of what transformations will occur with each character. As a disclaimer, some characters have capitalisation enforcement, e.g.capitals at the start of each sentence, no random capitals unless in a group to account for yelling. This will unfortunately result in capitalisation for proper nouns being removed e.g. "I greet Ms. Leijon without issuing a statement of a%ion in the first person" is perfectly correct, but the translator will produce "I greet ms Leijon without issuing a statement of a%ion in the first person". Relatedly, for characters that don't use punctuation (such as how Equius does not use terminal punctuation) this may be omitted when it should be kept. In the stated example above, the period is removed as this is terminal punctuation, however it's not being used as terminal punctuation. This may also disrupt typed emotes, however these edge cases are used far less frequently and I reccomend that you add these in post translation yourself.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Canon characters</strong></h3>
                    <p>Translators that comply with canon text, as much as possible. Note that some characters, such as ancestors, appear only in the Unda Canon as there is so little of their text (if any) that translation rules are more fanon than canon.</p>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Aradia</h3>
                    <p>Aradia's text is converted all to lower case, if the checkbox is ticked to allow caps then she will have her text changed to lower case unless it is several characters in a row that are capitalised. This permits her rare use of caps, but can be toggled on and off. There is a similar optional transformation to turn "o" and "O" into "0" which can be toggled at will. Aradia's text is then scrubbed of punctuation that she doesn't use: "",", ".", "?", ";", "'"</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Tavros</h3>
                    <p>Tavros's text is first converted to upper case and then character at the beginning of sentences are changed to lowercase. Then all terminal punctuation "." "!" and "?" are converted into commas.</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Sollux</h3>
                    <p>Sollux has multiple variations, his standard translation, the blind version, and then the half-dead version. All of his versions undergo caps enforcement before being further translated as capital letters converted to numbers won't read as a string of capitals and words like "TEST" can be incorrectly converted to "TE2t", thus the caps conversion that allows shouting is done first.</p>
                    <ul><li><strong>Standard: </strong>The standard Sollux output makes the following translations:
                        <li>"to" and "too" as isolated words become "two", this will not turn "tone" into "twone".</li>
                        <li>"into" becomes "intwo" as an isolated word, will not to "intone" into "intwone".</li>
                        <li>"today" "tomorrow" "together" and "tonight" all get converted to their two form if they are a whole word, or if the character after them is punctuation. This is to allow for "twomorrow's" type exceptions.</li>
                        <li>"s" and "S" are converted to "2".</li>
                        <li>"i" and "I" are doubled.</li>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Blind: </strong> Blind Sollux takes the input text and replaces "o" and "O" with "0".</li>
                    <li><strong>Half Dead: </strong> Half dead Sollux also converts his "o"'s into "0"'s but he does this only for every even numbered "o". </li></ul></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Karkat</h3>
                    <p>Karkat's text is converted into uppercase.</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Nepeta</h3>
                    <p>Nepeta has the option of beginning her messages with her matching little moirail emote that joins with Equius's, this can be included or excluded. Nepeta's text is caps corrected to be primarily lowercase but allowing for instances of uppercase shouting, and instances of "ee" are converted to "33", however this will only happen in multiples of two as to reflect the double lusus mouth (:33) so converting this "ee eee eeee" will return "33 33e 3333". She then has the following punctuation removed: ",", ".", "'" in line with her canon useage.</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Kanaya</h3>
                    <p>Kanaya's text is first converted to lowercase and then the first letter of each word is converted to uppercase. She then has all forms of punctuation removed.</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Terezi</h3>
                    <p>Terezi's text is first converted into all upper case. The following transformations are then applied:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"A" is converted to "4".</li>
                        <li>"I" is converted to "1".</li>
                        <li>"E" is converted to "3". These three are a nod to the blind prophets numbers.</li>
                        <li>The following punctuation is removed: ".", ",", "'"</li>
                    </ul></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Vriska</h3>
                    <p>Vriska's text is converted to produce sentences that start with capital letters, permit bouts of yelling in all caps, and removes errant capitals that might be scattered in. This is done before her pun replacements starts. Her properly formatted text is checked against a list of hundreds of possible pun-based substitutions, where the number "8" is substituted for both the letter "b" in any case, and any word that rhymes with "eight/ate". You may come up with puns that I have not thought of, or you may find that some don't scan due to differences in accent. Feel free to amend these yourself afterwards.</p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Equius</h3>
                    <p>Equius's messages have a toggled option to include his matching moirail emote to Nepeta's at the start of his messages. The user will be presented with a pun and a non-pun variation of his translation. The pun version is created before all other translations on the text, and makes use of the typical horse/cow puns that the Zahhak's use. There are about 40 unique puns in there (not accounting for case variations), there are of course more that can be added but there's only so many you can add in before all text becomes puns. Therefore the non-pun version is presented as well, allowing you to pick and choose which you want to keep while also making use of his other text translations. These translations are as follows: </p>
                    <ul><li>Equius' text uses standard capitalisation for the most part, so isolated capitals are removed and then his text is capitalised at the beginning of his sentences.</li>
                    <li>strong related words (strong/strength/strongness/strongest) are capitalised.</li>
                    <li>"x/X" are turned into "%"</li>
                    <li>The characters "loo" in his text are replaced with "100", he does this somewhat inconsistently with things that sound like that, so if you're wishing to have that replacement, I reccomend typing that as "loo" to get the conversion to trigger. E.g. "bloo" or "floo" for "blue" and "flew" so that you can get "b100" and "f100".</li>
                    <li>The characters "ool" are replaced with "001", again he sometimes does this with similar sounds, so if you're wanting to trigger that, then spell it accordingly.</li>
                    <li>The word "cross" in any case is replaced with "%"</li>
                    <li>Terminal punctuation (".", "!", "?") is removed from Equius's text. This will overcorrect in instances when terminal punctuation is not being used as terminal punctuation, such as using periods in acronyms or forms of address "e.g.", "Ms. Lejion", this will need to be added back in after translation manually.</li></ul></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Gamzee</h3>
                    <p>Gamzee's text translator has two boxes for the two variations of his typing quriks, as well as a checkbox for his sober status, producing four possible translation outputs. Sometimes Hussie wrote Gamzee alternating his high typing quirk between starting with a lowercase or an uppercase, especially in messages that followed each other without another character interrupting (see his early conversations with Karkat). However, sometimes this isn't the case (see his first messages with Dave). The variations are there so you can choose which you want. In his sober state, Gamzee alternates between one message in lowercase and the next in uppercase, beginning new conversations in lowercase and then alternating one after another, not resetting when others reply.</p>
                    <li><strong>high </strong>- Caps alternate, ignoring punctuation and spaces. Begins on a captial letter.</li>
                    <li><strong>high</strong>- Caps alternate, ignoring punctuation and spaces. Begins on a lowercase letter.</li>
                    <li><strong>sober </strong>- all lowercase.</li>
                    <li><strong>sober </strong>- all uppercase.</li></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Eridan</h3>
                    <p>Eridan has a pun and non-pun output, these are run before any other text transformation takes place. There are approximately 113 seadweller puns that can be made, though you may wish to discard some due to frequency. his text then goes through the following transformations:</p>
                    <ul><li>Text is put through the "ing translator", this is a list of approximately 157 unique word replacements and their case variations. This removes the "g" and the end of "ing" ending words where appropriate, typically when used as a suffix, but not always. So "sing" won't be modified but "singing" will be converted to "singin". This explicitly covers words that fall under the seadweller pun list.</li></ul></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Feferi</h3>
                    <p></p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Kankri</h3>
                    <p></p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Mituna</h3>
                    <p></p></div>
                </p>
                    <h3><strong>Unda Canon characters</strong></h3>
                    <p>Translators adapted to typing quirks unique to Unda's work.</p>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Disciple</h3>
                    <p>Disciple has a toggle option to allow her text to be bracketed with her partner's signs and respective colours, as seen in Unda works. Her text is capitalised at the beginning of her sentences, other caps use is preserved outside of this. Uses of "ee" or "EE" will be convered to "33", however this will only happen in multiples of two as to reflect the double lusus mouth (:33) so converting this "ee eee eeee" will return "33 33e 3333".</p></div>

                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Psiionic</h3>
                    <p>Psiionic's text is all converted to lowercase and then the first letter of each sentence is then capitalised. Then his text is mutated to allow for two-based-puns and number substitutions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"to" and "too" as isolated words become "two", this will not turn "tone" into "twone".</li>
                        <li>"into" becomes "intwo" as an isolated word, will not to "intone" into "intwone".</li>
                        <li>"today" "tomorrow" "together" and "tonight" all get converted to their two form if they are a whole word, or if the character after them is punctuation. This is to allow for "twomorrow's" type exceptions.</li>
                        <li>Instances of the letter "s" are converted to the number 2.</li>
                        <li>Instances of the letter "i" are doubled.</li>
                        <li>The letters "l" and "o" are converted to "1" and "0" as a nod to binary.</li>
                        <li>Psiionic omits the following punctuation marks "," ";" and ":"</li>
                    </ul></div>                    
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Signless</h3>
                    <p>Signless has the first letter of each sentence capitalised, but does not have any other enforced capitalisation rules, as to allow for the rare vast expletive and acronyms. Punctuation is unmodified but should be written as standard. He has two text replacements:</p>
                <ul><li>"b" and "B" are convered to "6".</li>
                    <li>"o" and "O" are converted to "9"</li></ul></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Kankri</h3>
                    <p></p></div>
                    <div class="character-info"><h3>Mituna</h3>
